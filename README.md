Description
---
This is the repo for the speedmeter android app. 
It can display some useful information about your route:
* The actual, real-time speed
* The time elapsed
* How many meters or kilometers you traveled
* Your maximum speed

THANKS TO SpeedMaster (https://github.com/flyingrub/SpeedMeter.git)

This project is inspired by SpeedMaster by flyingrub.
This SpeedMeter based project only added data collection module.
I know android develop and java develop little, Hence, code convert from Java to Kotlin may take some time.
Deprecated methods cleaning up is also work in process.
